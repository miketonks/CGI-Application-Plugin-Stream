CGI/Application/Plugin/Stream version 1.00
==========================================

This plugin provides a way to stream a file back to the user from
within your runmode.  This would be useful if you have a button or
link on a page somewhere to prompt for a download.  Then when the
user clicks the link/button, it calls this runmode, which will
prompt a download session, delivering the file to the user through
the browser's download functionality.
